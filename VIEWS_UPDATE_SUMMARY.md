3. **Document Releaser** → Release & Send to employees
4. **Employee** → View, Mark Seen, Take Action
5. **Event Manager** → Manage events & view system overview

## Statistics Integration

All dashboards now use the correct statistics from `DocumentWorkflowService::getDashboardStats()`:

### Records Officer Stats:
- `pending_documents`
- `total_received` 
- `forwarded_today`

### Approving Authority Stats:
- `pending_review`
- `approved_documents`

- `pending_action`

### Event Manager Stats:
- `total_events`
- `upcoming_events`

## Key Workflow Improvements in Views

1. **Clear Role Separation**: Each dashboard shows only relevant information for that role
2. **Proper Status Handling**: Views correctly handle new `forwarded_to_releaser` status
3. **Accurate Button Labels**: Action buttons reflect actual workflow steps
4. **Real-time Statistics**: Statistics accurately reflect current system state
5. **Enhanced User Experience**: Better organization and clearer workflow indicators

## Next Steps for Complete Implementation

1. **Controller Updates**: Ensure controllers pass correct data to views
2. **Route Updates**: Verify all routes support the new workflow
3. **Middleware**: Ensure proper role-based access control
4. **Testing**: Test each role's dashboard with actual data

All views are now properly aligned with the 5-role workflow system and will correctly display information once the corresponding controllers are updated to pass the appropriate data.
